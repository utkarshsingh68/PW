## Required Python Libraries

Install the necessary Python libraries used in this project by using the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Streamlit App

After installing the required libraries, launch the web application with:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the Crypto Liquidity Predictor interface in your default web browser.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and **liquidity** — the ease of buying or selling an asset without causing significant price changes — plays a vital role in this volatility.

A **liquidity crisis** can cause abrupt price swings, erode market confidence, and increase risks for traders and exchanges.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that:  
- Predicts liquidity levels using features such as trading volume, transaction patterns, and social sentiment.  
- Provides early warnings of potential liquidity crises.  
- Assists financial platforms and traders in effectively mitigating risk.

## 🔄 Machine Learning Lifecycle

The project follows these phases:  
1. Problem Understanding  
2. Data Collection  
3. Data Preprocessing  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Feature Engineering  
6. Model Selection & Training  
7. Model Evaluation  
8. Hyperparameter Tuning  
9. Model Deployment  
10. Reporting & Documentation  

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a robust machine learning pipeline to:  
- Predict the **liquidity score or level** of cryptocurrencies.  
- Enable proactive risk management for exchanges, investors, and regulators.  
- Leverage historical crypto data and engineered features (e.g., volatility, moving averages, transaction volume) to train effective predictive models.
