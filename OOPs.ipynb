        "4 What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation+ ?\n",
        "Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming, but they serve different purposes. Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details from the user and only showing the essential features of an object. It helps reduce complexity by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. For example, when we use a smartphone, we don’t need to know the internal circuits or code — we just see the interface and perform actions like calling or texting. On the other hand, encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and methods together into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components. This is done to protect the data from outside interference and misuse. It focuses on controlling how the data is accessed and modified, usually using access modifiers like private, public, or protected. So, while abstraction is about hiding complexity and showing only the relevant parts, encapsulation is about securing data and keeping it safe within the object. Both work together to make programs more organized, secure, and easy to manage.\n"

        "\n",
        "With polymorphism, you can define a common interface (like a method name) in a parent class, and let each child class customize the behavior. This means you can write general-purpose code that works with objects of different types without knowing their exact class. This is especially useful in large applications where multiple classes share similar functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose you have a function that calls a method draw() on a list of shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles. Each shape can have its own version of draw(), but the function doesn't need to know what kind of shape it’s dealing with. It just calls draw() and trusts that the object will respond correctly. This is runtime polymorphism, and it helps in reducing code duplication and increasing modularity."

        "\n",
        "1. Modularity\n",
        "OOP allows breaking down a program into smaller, self-contained objects (classes), each handling specific functionality. This makes the code more organized and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Code Reusability\n",

        "3. Encapsulation\n",

        "4. Polymorphism\n",
        "With polymorphism, the same interface (like a method name) can work differently based on the object. This adds flexibility and makes it easier to extend functionality without changing existing code.\n",
